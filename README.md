# Iris Dataset
Exploratory data analysis on the dataset along with a few classification models.
## DATASET OVERVIEW

It includes three iris species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. 
One flower species is linearly separable from the other two, but the other two are not linearly separable from each other. 
This dataset has been taken from kaggle.

The columns in this dataset are:

1. Id
2. SepalLengthCm
3. SepalWidthCm
4. PetalLengthCm
5. PetalWidthCm
6. Species (Iris-setosa,Iris-versicolor,Iris-virginica)

## Exploratory Data Analysis
In order to get an insight into the dataset, I have used matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create scatterplots,boxplots etc. 
This helped me in visualising the relationship between the predictors and the target variable(Species) and also correlation between the predictor variables.

## Classification Models
I used Random Forest,KNearestNeighbors, and Support Vector Machine and obtained 100% test-set accuracy in all.

** Any insights or changes are most welcome!
